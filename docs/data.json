Google's Gary Illyes explained that ccTLDs help Google understand the site's target audience, giving an edge to local sites. However, it's essential to note that building a ccTLD requires the same effort as any other website, and simply having a ccTLD doesn't guarantee high rankings. Using localized language on the website further enhances its visibility in regional searches.",
