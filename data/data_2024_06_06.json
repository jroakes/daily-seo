With about ten percent of global search traffic, Bing aims to further close the gap by integrating ChatGPT plugins for sites like Expedia, Instacart, Zillow, and Redfin. However, this integration has sparked controversy in the real estate community over data sharing practices, raising concerns about legality and control over property listings. An investigation may be on the horizon as the industry reacts to Bing's expanding capabilities.",
